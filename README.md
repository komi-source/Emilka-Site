## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Content:** Chapters are loaded dynamically using JavaScript for a seamless experience.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Easily switch between chapters to follow the story.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for reading on both mobile devices and desktops.
- **Regular Updates:** New chapters (like 38 and 39) are added frequently via GitHub integration.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Vanilla JavaScript:** I used pure JS for managing the state of the book and rendering text content without heavy frameworks.
- **State Management:** The application tracks the current chapter and updates the UI in real-time.
- **Automated Deployment:** Connected to Netlify for continuous delivery every time a new chapter is pushed to the repository.
